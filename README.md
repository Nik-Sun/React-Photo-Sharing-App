# Photo Sharing App

## Introduction 
Did you know that over a billion people use Instagram to share and view photos? In today's fast-paced world, visual content is more important than ever. That's why I created a photo sharing and downloading app as my project defence work for the React/JS course @ Softuni. This app is designed to cater to photo enthusiasts of all levels and provides an easy-to-use platform for sharing, downloading, and browsing high-quality images.

Here are the libraries I used to create this app:

#### "cloudinary": "^1.35.0",
#### "react": "^18.2.0",
#### "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
#### "react-router-dom": "^6.9.0",
#### "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
#### "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
